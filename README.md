# SMD_tape_cartridge
Cartridges for SMD tapes for small scale manual assembly. 

Inspired/copied from the project at hackaday.io. 

Help wanted: (things that still need doing)... 
* Check if scaling the sizes works as expected.    
  Some stuff in the code is still "ugly constants" and 
  should be calculated from say the "size" variable. 
  
* Figure out a way to make the tape-height-gap adjustable, 
  then you don't need several different versions for different 
  tape thickness values. 
  
* maybe the "with spring" version (from the hackaday project)
  is more durable. Add it back?
  
* consider adding a manual feed lever. Engage in the holes in the 
  tape, move precisely 4mm, and release. 
  
* Consider allowing/adding computerized feed. 

* The peelback angle is specified in a datasheet I came across as
  170 to 180 degrees. i.e. the current 30 degrees in this design is
  too shallow. consider fixing this. (I haven't tried it yet). 
  
* Design the RAIL system.
